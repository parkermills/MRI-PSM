PSM Tutorial

===== Contents =====
1) Install PSM
2) Load Tutorial Dataset
3) Unwrap Phase Image
4) Run PSM



1) Install PSM
Open MATLAB and choose "Set Path..." in the "File" menu.
In the window tha topens, click "Add with Subfolders" and navigate to the directory/folder that contains the PSM code.
Select this directory by clicking "Ok", then click "Save" to add these paths to MATLAB.
PSM is now installed.



2) Load Tutorial Dataset
In MATLAB, run the commands:
>> load cmu_gel_3_magnitude
>> load cmu_gel_3_phase



3) Unwrap Phase Image
The phase image you imported has phase unwrapping artifacts!
To remove these we'll export the phase image to NII format, then run PRELUDE to perform 3D phase unwrapping.
This step can only be performed on a Linux or Mac OS X platform

In MATLAB, run the commands:
>> save_nii(make_nii(single(cmu_gel_3_phase)),'wrapped_phase');
>> system('prelude_macosx -n 15 -p wrapped_phase.hdr -a wrapped_phase.hdr -f -o unwrapped_phase&');
>> load_nii('unwrapped_phase');
>> unwrapped_phase = unwrapped_phase.img;



4) Run PSM
PSM_result = PSM(unwrapped_phase, '3d');
