PSM Tutorial

===== Tutorial Outline =====
1) Install PSM
2) Load Tutorial Dataset
3) Unwrap Phase Image
4) High-pass Filter the Unwrapped Phase
4) Run PSM



1) ==== Install PSM ====
Open MATLAB and choose "Set Path..." from the "File" menu (newer versions have 'Set Path' under the 'Home' tab)
In the window that topens, click "Add with Subfolders" and navigate to the directory/folder that contains this PSM code.
Select this directory by clicking "Ok", then click "Save" to add these paths to MATLAB.
PSM can now be used by MATLAB.



2) ==== Load Tutorial Dataset ====
In MATLAB, run the commands:
>> load cmu_gel_3_magnitude
>> load cmu_gel_3_phase



3) ==== Unwrap Phase Image ====
The phase image you imported has phase unwrapping artifacts!
To remove these we'll export the phase image to NII format, then run PRELUDE to perform 3D phase unwrapping.
This step can only be performed on a Linux or Mac OS X platform

In MATLAB, change your current directory to the folder that contains the PSM code (PSM.m), then run the commands:
>> cmu_gel_3_mask = imfill(logical(cmu_gel_3_magnitude > 0.03),'holes'); % Create a mask for the dataset
>> save_nii(make_nii(single(cmu_gel_3_magnitude)), 'magnitude'); % Export the dataset's magnitude image
>> save_nii(make_nii(single(cmu_gel_3_mask)), 'mask'); % Export the dataset's mask
>> save_nii(make_nii(single(cmu_gel_3_phase)),'wrapped_phase'); % Export the dataset's phase image
>> setenv('FSLOUTPUTTYPE', 'NIFTI_GZ');

If you're on a linux platform, next run:
>> system('./dependencies/prelude_linux -n 3 -p wrapped_phase.hdr -a magnitude.hdr -m mask.hdr -f -o unwrapped_phase&');

Otherwise, if you're in Mac OS X, run this:
>> system('./dependencies/prelude_macosx -n 3 -p wrapped_phase.hdr -a magnitude.hdr -m mask.hdr -f -o unwrapped_phase&');

Then wait 5 seconds for phase unwrapping to complete, then run:

>> unwrapped_phase = load_nii('unwrapped_phase.nii');
>> unwrapped_phase = unwrapped_phase.img;



4) ==== High-pass Filter the Unwrapped Phase ====
>> high_pass_filtered_phase = high_pass(unwrapped_phase, 5, 0.1);



4) ==== Run PSM ====
PSM_result = PSM(high_pass_filtered_phase, '3d');

That's it! The PSM_result data structure (MATLAB object) contains products that are described in the file PSM.m
